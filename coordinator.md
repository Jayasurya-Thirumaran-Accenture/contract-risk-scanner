# Coordinator — Financial Contract Risk Report
 
## Task
Produce a contract risk report for the file named in the request
(default: input/sample_contract.txt). Follow CLAUDE.md.
 
## Steps
1. Read the contract file once using the Read tool.
2. In a single step, launch these three sub-agents IN PARALLEL.
   Pass each one the full contract text — they do not share your context:
     - clause-agent      → P1/P2/P3 clause findings table
     - obligation-agent  → Key obligations for each party
     - risk-agent        → Overall risk rating + critical summary
3. Wait for all three to finish. Merge their sections in this order;
   do not rewrite or paraphrase any finding:
     Risk Rating → P1 Critical Clauses → P2 Major Clauses →
     P3 Minor Clauses → Key Obligations → Run Info
4. Append GATE: FAIL if any P1 finding exists, otherwise GATE: PASS.
5. Write the result to output/risk_report.md.
